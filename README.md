This GitHub repository contains an SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model for assessing the effectiveness of interventions in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The model incorporates different clinical trajectories of infection, interventions to reduce transmission, and comparisons of various control strategies.

Key Features:
EDA on Covid-19 dataset for 2020, implementation of an SEIR model for COVID-19 infection dynamics, assessment of the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and comparison of various control strategies

Technologies and Tools:

Programming language: Python, 

Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Future Plans:
Exploration of additional intervention strategies, Integration of deep learning approaches for improved performance and Expansion of the dataset for more accurate predictions and analysis
